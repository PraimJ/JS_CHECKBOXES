# JS_CHECKBOXES
This is a checkbox hold on your shift key you click 
another one and all the check boxes in between the 
first one and the second one that you clicked will 
then be checked this works top to bottom but also 
bottom to top so if I click on this one hold on shift 
click on here it's going to go bottom to top so it goes 
all ways depending on what you're working on.
